# ðŸ“š Bookstore Database Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a **MySQL relational database** to manage a bookstoreâ€™s operations. It includes creating tables for books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more, along with managing user access and performing queries for analysis.
